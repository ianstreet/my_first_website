<h1>Layout is dead, long live layout</H1>


<ol>

<li>The roots of the web design are in print design. There is text and image content, typography and layout. But there are also <li>differences. In print design you have the page size first, and you divide it into layout, deciding which part is for the <li>title, text and images.
</ol>

<h2>subitle</h2>
In online design there is no page size. The size of the viewport comes from the device, it can be a huge desktop screen, a mid size notebook screen, a tablet a mobile or even a smartwatch display. Not only the sizes are different, but also the formats. A mobile can be landscape and portrait format with a single move.
